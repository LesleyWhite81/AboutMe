            <h3>The beginning</h3>       
            <p>I started my career in technology as a QA team lead.<br> I was promoted into the role and thrown in to the fiery pits of hell which was a major systems migration and replatforming. Needless to say it did not go too well as i had no formal training and the company i worked with did not quite understand the role of a QA either. <br>Lots of lessons learned which i took away and created a successful team in the organisation that spanned multiple countries.<br> After about 10 years of being a QA team lead and my ability to get things done in a timely fashion, i was given another opportunity...</p>

            <h3>The middle</h3>
            <p>The new opportunity to lead a cross skilled team and implement agile (as far as i could as the organisation needed to change to fully embrace it).<br> I led a team of devleopers and Quality enginners that dealt with small changes that kept the business running whilst there were big projects happening in parralel.<br> I implemented scrum framework within the team and we did what we could without there being CI/CD. We were successful in driving small change with the limitations we had... which then, another opportunity arose which my peers saw that i could grow and fill...

            <h3>The End Game</h3>
            <p>The business wanted to become agile! A major replatforming of one of our core products started. As i had already showcased my skills when leading a cross functional team, i was head hunted to become the teams scrum master. I got myself a formal scrum master qualification and we implemented CI/CD. I then got promoted to delivery manager after successfully coaching the team and helping the team meet their targets and delivery times.
              This leads me to the end game, i started to make small amends in the code and fell in love. I am now learning front end skills to become a front end developer.
